# SentinelDNS Agent Rules

- Read docs/BUILD_SPEC.md before coding.
- Keep everything runnable on macOS without cloud services.
- Prefer small, testable changes.
- After changes, run `make test` (or at least the command that failed) and fix issues.
- Update README when commands change.
- Avoid adding dependencies unless necessary.
